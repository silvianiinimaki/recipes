# Recipe -app

This is a recipe app where user can search new recipes from an API, save them, create their own recipes and edit saved recipes.
The app is implemented with Kotlin in Android Studio.

## About the project

I created this project in the spring of 2021 as my first whole Kotlin-app. I had so much fun designing the layout and the features.
Only regret I have is the API I used, because it didn't return enough details of the recipes and the user has to go to different websites to get more information.
I did add a button to the recipes, so it's as easy as possible to toggle between the source website and the app.
